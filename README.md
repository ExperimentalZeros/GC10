# GC10
- Development on the "GC10NEXT" Geiger Counter on "Node-RED" ("https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/")
- Most of the Node-RED code fundamentals came from reading ("https://github.com/netio-devices/gc10next/blob/main/main.c")
- I would like to add more features, specially for the "GC10NEXT DUAL", for example to:
  1.- display the 2 "GM" channels data,
  2.- display inmidiate data from the device, along with the "average/moving" data every second, for fast response awareness.
  3.- Alarms ranges.
  4.- TBD.
- I am only interested in making this work in LINUX, if someone decides to have it run in Windows, do create a different branch.
- The app got put together the same day I received the device. No major thought was put into it: it is Work In Process at my pace.
